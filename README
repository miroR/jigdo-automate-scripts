After download of these in a single empty dir, where you have room enough
to download/for already (the previous week) downloaded jigdo ISO files, of
these:
run_CMD_02.sh
jigdo-dl_01-jigdo-templ-t.sh
jigdo-dl_02-mnt-t.sh
jigdo-dl_03-dLo-SUMS.sh
jigdo-dl_04-dLo-t.sh
iso_check-del_02.sh
prep4iso_check-del.sh
README

you can run:
$ chmod 755 *.sh

on them, to make them executable.

The only one that is best be moved in the /usr/local/bin/ is:

run_CMD_02.sh

because you can use it for many sorts of repetitive tasks.

Let's say that empty dir we mentioned at the top is /home/me/Debian/ (pls.
replace me with your username, such as that if your user name is ukrainian, you
get /home/ukrainian/Debian/.

Now create just the directory:
/home/me/Debian/Old/

and if you have the last week's or last month's jigdo testing ISO files, put
them in:
/home/me/Debian/Old/

Connect to internet (we who try and apply basic anti-surveillance to keep our
lives private from secret services wholesale unwarranted surveillance only
connect when we need, and don't keep online unnecessarily) now, and run, first:

./jigdo-dl_01-jigdo-templ-t.sh

which will get you all the templates (in case there is ISO 13 or later out
added, add a line that downloads it/them as well).

As root run:
./jigdo-dl_02-mnt-t.sh

It will mount the ISOs from the Old dir appropriately. You need to have a
kernel that can create sufficient number of loop devices. The Grsecurity
patched kernel that I occasionally post for download on www.CroatiaFidelis.hr
is adequately configured in that respect as well. Pls., again see my
tip/tutorial on forums.debian.net "Grsecurity/Pax installation on Debian
GNU/Linux", again, if I'm not kicked out for my strong criticism for their
inadequate/false protection of users wrt freedom/privacy which is only achieved
through genuine security.

This, then:

./jigdo-dl_03-dLo-SUMS.sh

will download the checksums. We'll use just MD5SUMS. The sums are anyway not
digitally signed by Debian Engineering Team, so why complicate when nothing to
really verify the GNU Privacy Guard way. Great if GNU/Linux Debian team decided
to digitally sign the weekly sums from some time to come, I wish!

./jigdo-dl_04-dLo-t.sh

here apply instructions that come with Jigdo, there are docs and faqs related.

You don't need to run prep4iso_check-del.sh. It will be called by
iso_check-del_02.sh.

But now you will put to real use the simplest of the script that you moved into
/usr/local/bin

Here's a possible command you can decide for:

As root:
run_CMD_02.sh 10000 30 ./iso_check-del_02.sh

It should check the ISO file that you downloaded and if the md5 is correct,
overwrite the old file in Old/ of which that ISO is the updated edition, and
it should do so for all the (in April 2014) twelve ISO files, and it will do
so unattended. BUT READ THE WARNING BELOW.

I'm not responsible it it doesn't. It works most of the time for me, but there
I could have introduced errors that I couldn't found all out in this newly
just revamped set of jigdo-automate-scripts.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Pls. refer to my Tips page Scripts to Automate Jigdo Downloads on
forums.debian.net

And pls. report there if anyhing is wrong with the script!

And I hope the Debian people keep patient with me, as they have mostly shown to
be so far, so I won't repeat the ifs again.

Only this one if begs repeating. I do live in a country gone to the worst
killers of WWII progenie, the Tito's partisans killers' children rule in my
country's Croatia, and are unbelievably strongly and fast allying themselves
to the worst haters and killers of Croats in the WWII that have risen to power
in Serbia, the Chetniks' progenie who even formally tout that name.

I am not safe in my country. If you don't hear/read from me (you could have
heard from me as I used to tape my voiceover in English in many of the over 500
--five hundred-- videos that I posted on Youtube through some five years
time)... 

If you don't hear from me in time longer then a few weeks or one, hardly two
months, don't believe any simplistic explanation that might be proposed. They
kill investigative journalists in the U.S. (Michael Hastings), and you think
that Tito's worst killers' children are nice with rightwings like me?

Thank you for bearing up with me. Don't forget my story!
